# Machine Learning from Scratch

This project is a learning-focused implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts and mathematics behind popular ML algorithms by implementing them without using high-level libraries.

## Objectives

- Implement core ML algorithms from scratch
- Understand the mathematical principles behind each algorithm
- Build a solid foundation in machine learning concepts
- Create clear, well-documented code for educational purposes

## Algorithms to be Implemented

- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] Neural Networks (Basic)
